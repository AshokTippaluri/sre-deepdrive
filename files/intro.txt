"Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone. My name is Ashok Chandra Reddy Tippaluri, and I am an experienced Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) and Cloud Engineer with over 4 years of experience in designing, automating, and maintaining scalable infrastructure.

Currently, I am working at Dotdash Meredith as an SRE, where I focus on cloud infrastructure automation, CI/CD pipeline optimization, and Kubernetes-based deployments. Before that, I worked as a NOC Engineer at Tanla Platforms, handling cloud migrations and monitoring infrastructure health.

My expertise includes:
✅ Cloud & Containers – AWS, Kubernetes (EKS, ECS), Docker
✅ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – Terraform, Ansible
✅ Automation & Scripting – Python, Shell scripting
✅ CI/CD & Monitoring – Jenkins, Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, Zabbix
✅ Web & Security – Nginx, ELK Stack, and AWS security best practices

In my current role, I have successfully migrated on-prem infrastructure to AWS, automated cloud provisioning using Terraform, and implemented CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins for Kubernetes deployments. I also focus on enhancing system reliability and reducing downtime using monitoring tools like CloudWatch, New Relic, and Zabbix.

I am passionate about automation, scalability, and improving system reliability, and I am excited about this opportunity to contribute my skills and learn from this team. Looking forward to the discussion!"
